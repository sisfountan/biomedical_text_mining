Although kratom has been traditionally used \\nfor stimulation and pain management in Southeast Asia, the mitragynine \\nbiosynthesis pathway has remained elusive. We embarked on a search for \\nmitragynine biosynthetic genes from the transcriptomes of kratom and other \\nmembers of the Rubiaceae family. We studied their functions in\\xa0vitro and \\nin\\xa0vivo. Our investigations led to the identification of several reductases and \\nan enol methyltransferase that forms a new clade within the SABATH \\nmethyltransferase family. Furthermore, we discovered a methyltransferase from \\nHamelia patens (firebush), which catalyzes the final step. With the tryptamine \\n4-hydroxylase from the psychedelic mushroom Psilocybe cubensis, we accomplished \\nthe four-step biosynthesis for mitragynine and its stereoisomer, speciogynine in \\nboth yeast and Escherichia coli when supplied with tryptamine and secologanin. \\nAlthough we have yet to pinpoint the authentic hydroxylase and methyltransferase \\nin kratom, our discovery completes the mitragynine biosynthesis. Through these \\nbreakthroughs, we achieved the microbial biosynthesis of kratom opioids for the \\nfirst time.
